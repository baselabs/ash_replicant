## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-08

First release: the complete Ash `Replicant.Sink` adapter with effect-once
semantics, fail-closed multitenancy, AshCloak integration, and compile-time
sensitive-column verification.

### Added

- **Ash resource extension** (`AshReplicant.Resource`) — a `replicant do ... end`
  DSL section for marking AshPostgres resources as CDC mirror targets. Options:
  `source_table`, `source_schema`, `tenant_attribute`, `tenant_mfa`, `sensitive`,
  `skip`, `on_truncate`, `on_schema_change`, `upsert_identity`.

- **Checkpoint macro** (`AshReplicant.Checkpoint`) — generates an AshPostgres
  resource backing the `ash_replicant_checkpoints` table (one row per slot,
  tracking the durable `commit_lsn` watermark). Bound to the host's repo and
  domain at compile time.

- **Sink-config macro** (`AshReplicant.Sink`) — generates a `Replicant.Sink`
  implementation with repo, domains, checkpoint resource, and `slot_name` baked in.
  The `slot_name` is the single source of truth for the replication slot (not a
  `start_link` option) and keys the resolver index.

- **Resource resolver** (`AshReplicant.Resolver`) — maps `{schema, table}` pairs
  to resources, built from the sink's domains. The index is cached in
  `:persistent_term` and accessed by the sink's transaction handler.

- **Sink action applier** (`AshReplicant.Apply`) — applies changes to mirror
  resources: upsert by PK, destroy, truncate per policy. All changes in a
  transaction run with `authorize?: false` at the boundary (Ash policies still
  gate the action definition; the flag exempts the sink's generated calls from
  re-gating). Tenant is passed per-row.

- **Compile-time verifiers** — enforce critical rules:
  - `ValidateSensitive`: each sensitive column maps to an AshCloak-encrypted
    attribute, a binary-storage attribute, or is skipped.
  - `ValidateMultitenancy`: a multitenant resource with a `tenant_attribute` has
    a plaintext, declared discriminator; the tenant is never classified or skipped.

- **Value-free error & telemetry boundaries** — sink failures and halt paths carry
  structure (error reason, table name, LSN) only. No row values, PKs, tenant names,
  or raw data appear in logs, errors, or telemetry. Column names are strings, never
  atoms.

- **Effect-once transaction model** — each `Replicant.Transaction` applies in one
  `Repo.transaction`: skip by commit-LSN watermark, apply rows, upsert checkpoint
  atomically. Failure rolls back; on resume, un-acked WAL re-streams and dedups
  against the durable checkpoint. Proven by crash-injection tests (loss = 0,
  effect-dup = 0).

- **Documentation** — `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
  `usage-rules.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`; tracked charter at
  `docs/CHARTER.md` (only `/docs/superpowers/` lifecycle artifacts are local-only).
